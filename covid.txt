### USA Gender Data ###

In the US alone, men are dying at alarmingly higher rates than women, accounting for roughly 54% of all deaths right now. Women only make up about 46%.
In terms of age group between the genders, the overall most vulnerable group to COVID are ages between 85 years and over.
Men however typically die a bit younger with their most vulnerable age group of 75-84 years taking the most amount of deaths while women are typically more vulnerable around 85 years and over.
Furthermore, we decided to compare COVID deaths with deaths of other and similar conditions that it is consistently compared to, for example Pneumonia and Influenza. For all of America, COVID19 and Pneumonia deaths are roughly equal and account for about 10% of all deaths while the flu accounts for only about 0.25% of all *reported* related deaths thus far this year. Men tend to die from COVID 10% of the time compared to pneumonia and the flu while women tend to die from COVID 9% of the time.

### Global Gender Data ###

Unfortunately, for a lot of countries, the gender distribution data is not provided. So take this data with a grain of salt.
In terms of gender data, the highest COVID count providing this data is Mexico, besides the United States. There, men account for 64% of all COVID deaths so far with females accounting for only 36%. That's quite alarming.
However, strangely enough, women make up the majority of the population at 51%, outnumbering men who make up only 49%

What is perhaps even more surprising, we looked at the age groups between men and women to see if there was a gender difference here.
